			Being asked to speak at my college fellowship group felt like being asked to fill in for Billy Graham at one of his crusades. The mere thought 
			made my palms sweat. The butterflies in my stomach turned to a flock of flapping birds. I was not public-speaking material. I was timid up front. 
			I was shy and awkward before others. I didn’t aspire to stand up and address even small gatherings, much less large crowds.

			<h4>Feature 2</h4>
			<p>
			God goes on to give Moses signs of his power to validate Moses’s mission (Exodus 4:1–9). God makes clear it’s his power that is behind all ministry, all

				Jan 30, 2018 - I learned that although the older version of Google Translate can handle a very large repertoire of languages, its new deep-learning incarnation ...

				Google Translate is a free multilingual machine translation service developed by Google, to translate text. It offers a website interface, mobile apps for Android ...
				Available in‎: ‎103 languages, see ‎below	Users‎: ‎Over 200 million people daily
			</p>
			<p>
				The Translation API provides a simple programmatic interface for translating an arbitrary string into any supported language using state-of-the-art Neural Machine 
				Translation. It is highly responsive, so websites and applications can integrate with Translation API for fast, dynamic translation of source text from the source language 
				to a target language (such as French to English). Language detection is also available in cases where the source language is unknown. The underlying technology is updated 
				constantly to include improvements from Google research teams, which results in better translations and new languages and language pairs.
